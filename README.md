# My project for ucode: Race00.
This is the first implementation of a full-fledged ini project under the "Innovation Campus" program from ucode. Here you will find a display of a cube and a pyramid with a free size that is greater than one.

#### Cubes and a pyramid - we all love these interesting geometric shapes, let's look at their representation in the console, with a conditional 3D understanding.

### This is a cube whose size is 4 n.

### This is a cube whose size is 32 n.

#### Such a pseudo-representation of the world in three dimensions is a formality for us, because it becomes such only during rotation, therefore now we see only a 2D plane, of course, everything will change if it is not a console, but some kind of environment for displaying 3D graphics.
